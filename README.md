# Scriven
Medi√¶val style font with support for constructed languages from the Ultima computer games.

It will support English written with Latin script as well as the Runes from the Unicode Runic block for writing English in the modes of the Ultima games (Sosarian Runes), Shroud of the Avatar (Novian Runes), or The Hobbit.

It will also support writing English using the Ophidian Alphabet from Ultima VII Part 2 and the Gargoyle language from Ultima VI and onward.  Both will follow the Under-Conscript Unicode PUA encoding.

I may add support for other constructed scripts outside of Ultima in future.  Cirth is likely and I may try to do Tengwar.  Other video game related scripts in Under-Conscript like D'ni and Standard Galactic or other constructed scripts like Aurebesh, pi'Qad, Shavian, or sitelen pona are possibilities.

The Latin miniscule is mostly based on Carolingian with some Insular touches. It is not meant to be representative of any one real historical script.  The style of the other scripts tries to look consistent with the Latin so that it looks like one scribe wrote them with one pen.
